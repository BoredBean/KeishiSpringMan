# SekibankiSpringMan
This mod replaces the model of SpringMan/CoilHead with the Touhou character Sekibanki.

The SpringMan/CoilHead will replace the spring/coil on a player's body with a head of Sekibanki, which can be configured.

## Issues

Plenty of.

The Blender and Unity related issues with the models are beyond my knowledge.

I would appreciate it if someone could help.
