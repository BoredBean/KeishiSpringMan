# TouhouEnemyModels
This mod replaces the model of enemies with **Touhou characters (modified)** and also adds their **theme music (shortened)**.
* Replaces the model of **SpringMan/CoilHead** to **Sekibanki**.
* The SpringMan/CoilHead can replace the **spring/coil** on a player's body with **a head of Sekibanki**.
* Replaces the model of **Nutcracker** to **Satori Komeiji**.

## Issues

Plenty of.

The Blender and Unity related issues with the models are beyond my knowledge.

I would appreciate it if someone could help.
