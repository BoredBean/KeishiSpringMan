# TouhouEnemyModels
---
**长时间的单独开发和稀少的反馈令我倍感孤独，所以我决定暂时停止更新此模组去做些其他事情。如果有人愿意加入或者接手项目，我可以提供开发教程。如果存在使用问题仍然可以提Issue，我会提供有限的维护。如有兴趣可在此项目或B站联系。**

**The long period of solitary development and the scarcity of feedback have made me feel very lonely, so I've decided to stop updating and do something else. I can provide tutorials if anyone wishes to join or take over the project. I will still provide some fixes for the issues. Prefer contact on Github or Steam instead of Discord.**

This mod replaces the model of enemies with **Touhou characters (modified)** and also adds their **theme music (shortened)**. 

Original work: **東方Project** by **上海アリス幻樂団**

* Replaces the model of **CoilHead** to **Sekibanki (赤蛮奇)**.

* Replaces the model of **ForestGiant** to **Suika Ibuki (伊吹萃香)**.

## Issues

Plenty of.

The Blender and Unity related issues with the models are beyond my knowledge.

I would appreciate it if someone could help.

**Always waiting for collaborators.**
