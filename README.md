# SekibankiSpringMan
This mod replace the model of SpringMan/CoilHead to the Touhou character Sekibanki.

The spring/coil on a body, which is killed by the SpringMan/CoilHead will be replaced with a head of Sekibanki. This is configurable.

## Issues

There are plenty of issues with the model,  but I don't have the specific knowledge to fix it.

This is mainly related to Blender and Unity.

I would be grateful if someone could help.
