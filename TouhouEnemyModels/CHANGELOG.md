### Release v0.9.5
1. Fixed [Nothing spawns when using 0.9.3 #5](https://github.com/BoredBean/TouhouCompany/issues/5).
2. Make the dependency of LCSoundTool weak, not realy need it now.
3. Add hungry Yuyuko hiding somewhere, but you will hardly see her.
4. Tried to reduce the size of the assetBundle. Unfortunately, it becomes larger!
5. Give up tuning the shader, use HDLethalCompany if you want a better looking.
6. Another version of HoarderBug. I call it KirisameBug.
7. Compatible with V49.
### Release v0.9.6
1. Optimize the size.
2. Add jiggle physics.
### Release v0.9.7
1. Fixed Old-Bird animations.
2. Fixed Utsuho animations.
* Note1: Old-Bird **stops moving** after a player is **grabbed** by Old-Bird but **not killed**. This **can be fixed** with a single **touch** to the Old-Bird from a player. **Not caused by this mod.**
* Note2: The missiles launched by **Utsuho** had 30%-50% of the **hit rate** of Old-Birds. This can be fixed, but it makes sense considering that Utsuho is not very smart. It also makes life easier.
### Release v0.9.8
1. This should fix an issue that prevents enemies from spawning.
### Release v0.9.9
1. Volume config for NutCracker Satori.
2. Volume config for OldBird Utsuho.
### Release v1.0.0
1. Compatible with [MoreCounterplay](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BaronDrakula/MoreCounterplay/). Now you can cut off Sekibanki's head and take it home. Chop-chop!
