# TouhouEnemyModels
---
**暂停开发去做更多新的尝试，如果有人愿意加入或者接手项目，我可以提供开发教程。如果存在使用问题仍然可以提Issue，我会提供维护。如有兴趣可在此项目或B站联系。感谢反馈。**

**I've decided to stop updating and try some new things. I can provide tutorials if anyone wishes to join or take over this project. I will still offer fixes to the issues. I prefer contact on Github or Steam instead of Discord. Thanks for your feedback.**

This mod replaces the model of enemies with **Touhou characters (modified)** and adds their **theme music (shortened)**. 

Original work: **東方Project** by **上海アリス幻樂団**

* Replaces the model of **CoilHead** to **Sekibanki (赤蛮奇)**. (Compatible with [MoreCounterplay](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BaronDrakula/MoreCounterplay/))
* The CoilHead can replace the **coil** on a player's body with **a head of Sekibanki**.
* Replaces the model of **Nutcracker** to **Satori Komeiji (古明地觉)**.
* Replaces the model of **ForestGiant** to **Suika Ibuki (伊吹萃香)**.
* Replaces the model of **HoarderBug** to **Marisa Kirisame (雾雨魔理沙)**.
* Replaces the model of **OldBird** to **Utsuho Reiuji (灵乌路空) (experimental)**.
* Replaces the model of **SandWorm** to **Yuyuko Saigyouji (西行寺幽幽子)**.

## Issues

1. ✅At v0.9.2, the client player cannot kill HoarderBugs. **Fixed at v0.9.3.**
2. ❌Dead enemies look still alive for later-join players. **Not gonna fix.**
3. ✅Volume configs for NutCracker and OldBird. **Fixed.**
4. ✅Clothes and hair are solid. **Jiggle physics added at v0.9.6.**
5. ❌Starry texture for Utsuho's cloak. Might be fixed in the future, not sure of that.
6. ✅The model meshes are becoming too large for a single mod. Trying to reduce the size. **Done.**
7. ℹ️Old-Bird **stops moving** if its **target(including giants)** is eaten by a **Sandworm** while attacking. **Not caused by this mod.**
8. ℹ️Old-Bird **stops moving** if a player is **grabbed** by Old-Bird but **not killed** by its flame. This **can be fixed** with a single **touch** to the Old Bird from a player. **Not caused by this mod.**
9. ℹ️The missiles launched by **Utsuho** had 30%-50% of the **hit rate** of Old-Birds. This can be fixed, but it **makes sense** considering that Utsuho is not very smart. It also makes life easier.


* Others:

The Blender and Unity-related issues with the models are beyond my knowledge.

I would appreciate it if someone could help.

**Always waiting for collaborators.**
