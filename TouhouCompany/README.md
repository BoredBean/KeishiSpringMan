# TouhouCompany
This mod replaces many objects with Touhou related assets. 

Original work: **東方Project** by **上海アリス幻樂団**

* Replaces the model of **Jack o' Lantern** to **YukuriReimu**.
* Replaces the model of **Plushie Pajama Man** to **上海人形**.

## Issues

* Others:

The Blender and Unity related issues with the models are beyond my knowledge.

I would appreciate it if someone could help.

**Always waiting for collaborators.**
